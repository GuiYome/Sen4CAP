gsubfn
***********************************
 The gsubfn function is like gsub but can take a replacement 
 function or certain other objects instead of the replacement string.
 Matches and back references are input to the replacement function and 
 replaced by the function output.   gsubfn can be used to split strings 
 based on content rather than delimiters and for quasi-perl-style string 
 interpolation. The package also has facilities for translating formulas 
 to functions and allowing such formulas in function calls instead of 
 functions.  This can be used with R functions such as apply, sapply,
 lapply, optim, integrate, xyplot, Filter and any other function that 
 expects another function as an input argument or functions like cat
 or sql calls that may involve strings where substitution is desirable.
 There is also a facility for returning multiple objects from functions
 and a version of transform that allows the RHS to refer to LHS used in
 the same transform.

   ascribed to the EPSG dataset which is made available at no charge. The 
   ownership of the EPSG dataset [OGP] must be acknowledged.
	3. Subsets of information may be extracted from the dataset. Users are 
   advised that coordinate reference system and coordinate transformation 
   descriptions are incomplete unless all elements detailed as essential 
   in OGP Surveying and Positioning Guidance Note 7-1 annex F are included.

   or (iii) conversion of parameters between 7-parameter geocentric

 libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:
	1.The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed below
	This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs
   (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)
	2.The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below
	This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs.
	3.The zlib License, which is listed below
	This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo
   SIMD extensions.

 The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
 with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or

 All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
 Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this

 conditions:
	(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
 README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
 unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
 must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
	(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
 documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
 the Independent JPEG Group".
	(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
 acknowledge us.
 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
 in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
 it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's

 We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
 commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
 assumed by the product vendor.
 The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
 ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
 but is also freely distributable.
 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
 support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
 to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
 algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
 by all standard GIF decoders.
 We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

PCRE
***********************************
 PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
 and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

 Release 10 of PCRE2 is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
 specified below. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc"
 directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data
 in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

 The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
 included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
 optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
 the library is built.

 PostGIS has dependencies on other libraries which are not under GPL and

 The following loader/dumper files are derivative works or direct ports
 of ShapeLib which is under an X/MIT License: loader/dbfopen,safileio.*,

proj.4
***********************************
 All source, data files and other contents of the PROJ.4 package are 
 available under the following terms.  Note that the PROJ 4.3 and earlier
 was "public domain" as is common with US government work, but apparently
 this is not a well defined legal term in many countries.  I am placing 
 everything under the following MIT style license because I believe it is
 effectively the same as public domain, allowing anyone to use the code as
 they wish, including making proprietary derivatives. 
 
 Though I have put my own name as copyright holder, I don't mean to imply
 I did the work.  Essentially all work was done by Gerald Evenden.

 A collection of various oversampling techniques developed from SMOTE is provided. SMOTE is a oversampling technique which synthesizes a new minority instance between a pair of one minority instance and one of its K nearest neighbor. (see <https://www.jair.org/media/953/live-953-2037-jair.pdf> for more information) Other techniques adopt this concept with other criteria in order to generate balanced dataset for class imbalance problem.

SQLite
***********************************
 All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means. 

 The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library. 

 All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

 The original TinyXML-1 has many contributors, who all deserve thanks
 in shaping what is a very successful library. Extra thanks to Yves
 Berquin and Andrew Ellerton who were key contributors.

 TinyXML-2 grew from that effort. Lee Thomason is the original author
 of TinyXML-2 (and TinyXML-1) but TinyXML-2 has been and is being improved
 by many contributors.
